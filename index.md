# *Who am I?*
Since September 2021, I have been an Associate Professor (Maîtresse de Conférences) at the [Laboratoire d’Informatique, Signaux et Systèmes (I3S)](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/en) with Université Côte d’Azur. I am a member of the research group Mediacoding belonging to the team Signals, Images and Systems (SIS) of the I3S laboratory. After a two-year post-doctoral stay (Sep. 2017–Aug. 2019) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland) in the [Adaptive Systems Laboratory (ASL)](https://asl.epfl.ch/), I joined the American University of Beirut (AUB, Lebanon) as an assistant professor where I taught several courses including digital communication systems, digital signal processing, digital image processing, and signals and systems. Prior to joining EPFL, I was a researcher and a teaching assistant (ATER) at the Electronics department of Université Côte d’Azur (Laboratoire Lagrange). Under the supervision of Professor Cédric Richard and Professor André Ferrari, I completed my PhD entitled “Distributed adaptive estimation over multitask networks” from University of Nice, Lagrange Laboratory, on November 30, 2016. I received the Dipl.-Ing. degree from the Lebanese University, Lebanon, and the M.S. degrees from Université de Technologie de Compiègne, France, in 2013, both in industrial control and electrical engineering.
