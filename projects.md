#### *CEDRO (Communication-Efficient Decentralized, Adaptive and Reliable Optimization over Multitask Graphs):*


CEDRO focuses on decentralized inference (stochastic optimization and learning) over graphs. The project recognizes that, in recent years, engineering systems are witnessing an increasing ability to collect data in decentralized and streamed manner. The focus will be on designing decentralized approaches where devices are collecting data in a continuous manner. The project also recognizes that modern machine learning applications (where large volumes of training data are generated continuously by a massive number of heterogeneous devices) have several key properties that differentiate them from standard distributed inference applications. Particular focus will be given to developing and studying approaches for decentralized learning in statistical heterogeneous (multitask) settings in the presence of limited communication resources and heterogeneous system devices. The project emphasis will specifically be on illustrating the interest of the proposed approaches in machine learning frameworks using publicly available datasets.
